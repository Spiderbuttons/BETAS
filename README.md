# Button's Extra Trigger Action Stuff

First off, if you are a mod user and not a mod author, you've made a wrong turn. This page isn't for you. Begone, user!

Button's Extra Trigger Action Stuff (BETAS for short) adds a bunch of new triggers, actions, and game state queries to the game for you to use in your mods. The actions and queries can be used for more than just trigger actions obviously, but many of them might not be so useful outside the context of one of the new triggers I've added.

If you are unfamiliar with Trigger Actions, [please see this page on the Stardew Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Trigger_actions).

Due to the number of things added by BETAS, the documentation has been split into four categories: Triggers, Actions, Game State Queries, and Tokenizable Strings. Please click on their respective links below to view detailed documentation for each feature added:

- [Triggers](Triggers.md)
- [Actions](Actions.md)
- [Game State Queries](GameStateQueries.md)
- [Tokenizable Strings](TokenizableStrings.md)
